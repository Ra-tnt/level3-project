# DevOps Bootcamp Level 3 Final Project

## Capstone Project

The aim of the level 3 project is to give you something to demonstrate to potential employers. You will use this as a showcase for the skills you have developed and the tools you have mastered.

## Files structure
### In the root directory you will find the files: 
#### *Secret.yaml (contains token to push the images and don't worry about the exposed password it has been changed)
#### *clusterrole.yaml
#### *serviceAccount.yaml
#### *roleBinding.yaml
#### *Makefile
Each microservice has its own directory. Each of which has a "tekton-tasks" directory that contain the tasks. In the root directory of the microservice you will find the pipeline and pipelineRun files.
